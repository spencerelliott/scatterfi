# Scatterfi

Welcome to the Scatterfi project. This Android application is meant to provide the ability to create a [Scatternet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatternet) network using the Bluetooth capabilites of any device.

In addition to creating the network, the application will also allow you to create and host meetings and get-togethers using your device. You will be able to keep track of users joining the network, chat messages and notes as well as share links and any other data using Intents. Currently, the application uses the Ring Of Masters protocol to create the Scatternet but the hooks are available to create new routing protocols easily.
